/*
Dialog Of Continuation
-----------------
ASM has a special problem: sometimes, when a user is working on a document for
too long, their login session dies. Fortunately, we have an Emergency Save
system that saves the user's work and lets them resume. This dialog informs
them that their progress has been restored.
